## Problem
For this assignment we were required to provided a detailed analysis on weather conditions for randomly selected coordinates then use this analysis to determine idealized spots for vacationing.

## Process
In order to achieve the desired results, I had to use various APIs to pull data in from sources and populate my dataset. Once compiled, I was able to assemble some graphics and perform some linear regressions on the dataset. This helped paint a definitive picture on the correlation between latitude and weather conditions. To choose idealized vacation locations, I used simple conditions to filter the dataset and overlaid that on maps.

## Execution Notes
These scripts make use of multiple APIs. Given time and experience, I believe there's a more elegant way to combine them and reduce the amount of time dedicated to API requests, let alone reduce the amount of API requests made.

## Limitations
The bottleneck for this script is the API request delay. I believe there is a better way to assemble these scripts should the need arise.
